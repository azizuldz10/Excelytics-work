## 🎯 What I Recommend

**START WITH: OPTION A + B HYBRID** (6-7 weeks)

```
Week 1-2: Revenue Analytics      ← MUST START HERE
Week 3-4: Customer Segmentation  ← FOUNDATION
Week 5-6: Unit Economics         ← CRITICAL
Week 7-8: Churn Analysis         ← VALUABLE

After: Forecasting + Advanced features (as needed)
```

**Why this path?**
- Revenue analytics answers: "What's driving money?"
- Segmentation answers: "Who are best customers?"
- Unit economics answers: "Is it actually profitable?"
- Churn analysis answers: "How do we retain?"
- Together: Complete foundation for data-driven decisions

**Expected outcome:** Professional analytics dashboard that drives strategic decisions
