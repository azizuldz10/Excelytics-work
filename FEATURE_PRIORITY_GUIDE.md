Priority: 1 (foundation untuk features lain)

WHY FIRST?
- Revenue adalah metric #1 untuk bisnis
- Breakdown by package/location/sales ‚Üí actionable insights
- User sudah upload data ‚Üí tinggal analyze
- Semua features lain build on top of ini

WHAT TO BUILD:
1. Revenue breakdown dashboard
   - Bar chart: Revenue by package

```

### ü•à RANK 2: Customer Segmentation Analysis ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
Impact: VERY HIGH (understand who are your customers)
Effort: 6-8 jam
Priority: 2 (depends on revenue analytics)

WHY IMPORTANT?
- Not all customers are equal
- Different segments ‚Üí different strategies
- Identify high-value vs low-value customers
- Guide targeted marketing & retention

WHAT TO BUILD:
1. Segment customers by:
   - Package (what they buy)
   - Location (where they are)
   - Revenue tier (how much they pay)
   - Status (active vs inactive)
   - Churn risk (likely to leave)

2. For each segment show:
   - Segment size (# customers)
   - Segment revenue
   - Revenue per customer
   - Growth rate
   - Churn rate
   - Key characteristics

3. Visualization:
   - Bubble chart: Segment size vs revenue
   - Heatmap: Location x Package performance
   - Pie chart: Revenue by segment
   - Table: Segment metrics

INSIGHTS EXAMPLE:
"Top 20% high-value customers = 70% of revenue"
"Depok location = 25% customers, 15% revenue (underperforming)"
"New customers (< 3 months) = 3x churn risk"
"H-MEKAR PRIME = most stable (5% churn)"

ACTIONABLE DECISIONS:
‚Üí Focus retention on high-value customers
‚Üí Investigate underperforming locations
‚Üí Better onboarding for new customers
‚Üí Replicate H-MEKAR PRIME success factors
```

### ü•â RANK 3: Profitability & Unit Economics ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```
Impact: VERY HIGH (know if business actually profitable)
Effort: 4-5 jam
Priority: 3 (critical for strategic decisions)

WHY CRITICAL?
- Revenue is NOT profit
- Some customers might be unprofitable
- Need to understand actual business performance
- Required for investor pitch, loan applications, etc

WHAT TO BUILD:
1. Input module (admin only):
   - Cost per customer (support, infrastructure)
   - Acquisition cost per customer
   - Sales commission (%)
   - Fixed monthly costs

2. Calculate:
   - Contribution margin = (Revenue - Variable Cost) / Revenue
   - Profit per customer = ARPU - Cost per customer
   - Payback period = Acquisition cost / Profit per customer
   - Total profit = Total revenue - Total costs
   - Profit margin % = (Profit / Revenue) √ó 100

3. Visualize:
   - Waterfall chart: Revenue ‚Üí Costs ‚Üí Profit
   - Profitability by segment
   - Profitability trend
   - Profit vs target gauge

INSIGHTS EXAMPLE:
"Actual profit margin 15%, target 25% ‚Üí Rp 10M gap!"
"High-value customers 35% margin, low-value 5% margin"
"Bandung 30% margin (profitable), Depok 8% (fix needed)"
"Need to reduce cost by Rp 500K to hit target"

DECISIONS:
‚Üí Raise prices untuk unprofitable segments
‚Üí Reduce cost (better sourcing, automation)
‚Üí Focus on high-margin packages
‚Üí Exit low-margin locations
```

2. Churn risk prediction:
   - Rule-based (simple): High support tickets ‚Üí risk

   - ML (future): Advanced prediction model
   - Risk score (0-100) per customer

3. Insights engine:
   - Top 5 churn drivers
   - High-risk customer list
   - Cohort that's churning
   - Retention leakage funnel

2. Customer forecast:
   - Projected customer count
   - Growth rate projection
   - Churn impact

3. Visualizations:
